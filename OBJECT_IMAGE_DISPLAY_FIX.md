# Object Image Display Fix

## Issue Description
The image display functionality in the object tab's "View" button was not showing images properly due to several issues in the image rendering pipeline.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Canvas Dimension Detection**: Canvas dimensions were being retrieved before the canvas was properly initialized
2. **Image Reference Management**: PhotoImage objects were being garbage collected due to improper reference handling
3. **Color Space Conversion**: Inconsistent BGR/RGB color space handling
4. **Error Handling**: Poor error handling that made debugging difficult
5. **Retry Logic**: No retry mechanism when canvas wasn't ready

## Files Fixed

### 1. `app/ui/dialogs/object_edit_dialog.py`
**Method**: `_display_image_on_canvas()`

**Key Improvements**:
- Added proper canvas update and dimension validation
- Implemented retry logic when canvas isn't ready (`window.after(100, retry)`)
- Better color space conversion handling (BGR, BGRA, RGB, Grayscale)
- Added padding to prevent images from touching canvas edges
- Proper image reference storage (`canvas.image = photo`)
- Better interpolation for image resizing (`cv2.INTER_AREA`)
- Added image info display (dimensions)
- Comprehensive error handling with visual error messages

### 2. `app/ui/components/object_selector.py`
**Method**: `_display_image()`

**Key Improvements**:
- Added proper canvas update before dimension retrieval
- Implemented retry mechanism for canvas readiness
- Enhanced image validation
- Better color space conversion
- Improved error handling with visual feedback
- Prevented image upscaling for better quality

## Key Technical Fixes

### Canvas Readiness Issue
```python
# Before (problematic)
canvas_width = self.canvas.winfo_width()
canvas_height = self.canvas.winfo_height()

# After (fixed)
self.canvas.update()
canvas_width = self.canvas.winfo_width()
canvas_height = self.canvas.winfo_height()

if canvas_width <= 1 or canvas_height <= 1:
    # Schedule retry after canvas is properly sized
    self.window.after(100, lambda: self._display_image_on_canvas(canvas, image))
    return
```

### Image Reference Management
```python
# Before (caused garbage collection)
photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(pil_image)
canvas.create_image(x, y, image=photo)

# After (proper reference handling)
photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(pil_image)
canvas.create_image(x, y, image=photo)
canvas.image = photo  # CRITICAL: Keep reference
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```python
# Before (silent failure)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error displaying image: {e}")

# After (visual feedback)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error displaying image: {e}")
    # Show error message on canvas
    canvas.delete("all")
    canvas.create_text(
        canvas.winfo_width() // 2,
        canvas.winfo_height() // 2,
        anchor="center",
        text=f"Error loading image:\n{str(e)}",
        fill="red",
        font=("Arial", 10)
    )
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_object_image_display.py`) that covers:
1. **ObjectEditDialog** image display functionality
2. **ObjectSelector** component testing
3. **Edge cases**: empty images, very small images, very large images
4. **Interactive testing** with user feedback

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test ObjectEditDialog
python test_object_image_display.py object_edit

# Test ObjectSelector
python test_object_image_display.py object_selector

# Test edge cases
python test_object_image_display.py edge_cases

# Run all tests
python test_object_image_display.py all
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the object view functionality should:

1. ✅ **Display images properly** in the object edit dialog
2. ✅ **Handle canvas initialization** correctly
3. ✅ **Show clear error messages** when image loading fails
4. ✅ **Support different image formats** (BGR, RGB, BGRA, grayscale)
5. ✅ **Scale images appropriately** without distortion
6. ✅ **Provide visual feedback** during loading and errors
7. ✅ **Handle edge cases** gracefully (empty, small, large images)

## Additional Improvements

1. **Image Info Display**: Shows image dimensions on the canvas
2. **Padding**: Prevents images from touching canvas edges
3. **Better Interpolation**: Uses `cv2.INTER_AREA` for better quality downscaling
4. **No Upscaling**: Prevents image quality degradation
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries if canvas isn't ready

## Validation

To verify the fix works:
1. Run the test suite
2. Open object edit dialog with actual object data
3. Check that images display properly in the Preview tab
4. Verify error handling by testing with invalid images

The fixes ensure robust, user-friendly image display across all object-related functionality in the application.
