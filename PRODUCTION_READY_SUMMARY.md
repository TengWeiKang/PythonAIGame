3. **Service Availability**: Application service health verification

**Metrics Collected:**
- **System Metrics**: CPU %, memory usage, disk space, process/thread counts
- **Application Metrics**: uptime, operation counters, cache statistics
- **Performance Metrics**: response times, throughput, error rates

**Health Check API:**
```python
health_monitor = get_health_monitor()
status = health_monitor.get_health_status()
metrics = health_monitor.get_metrics()
```

### ✅ Stage 5: Enhanced Error Handling (COMPLETE)

**Achievements:**
