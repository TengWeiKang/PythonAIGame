   - Clean, maintainable architecture
   - Legacy code preserved as `.bak` files

3. **Production-Grade Structured Logging**
   - Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Security-safe message sanitization
   - Multiple output formats (JSON/human-readable)
   - Automatic log rotation
   - Dedicated security audit logging

4. **Health Monitoring & Metrics**
   - Real-time health checks (system resources, services, configuration)
   - Comprehensive metrics collection (system + application)
   - Background monitoring with configurable intervals
   - Export capabilities for external monitoring systems

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive exception hierarchy
   - All error paths logged with correlation IDs
   - Security event integration
   - Graceful degradation and resource cleanup

## Usage Examples

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start production-ready application
python main.py
```

### Testing
```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
python run_tests.py all

# Quick development tests
python run_tests.py quick

# Security tests only
python run_tests.py security

# Performance validation
python run_tests.py performance

# CI/CD pipeline tests
python run_tests.py ci
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
from app.core.health_monitor import get_health_monitor

# Get current system health
health_status = get_health_monitor().get_health_status()
print(f"System Status: {health_status['status']}")

# Get performance metrics
metrics = get_health_monitor().get_metrics()
print(f"CPU: {metrics['system']['cpu_percent']}%")
print(f"Memory: {metrics['system']['memory_percent']}%")
```

### Structured Logging
```python
from app.core.logging_config import get_logger, CorrelationContext

# Use correlation context for request tracking
with CorrelationContext() as corr_id:
    logger = get_logger(__name__)
    logger.info("Processing request", extra={
        'operation': 'image_detection',
        'user_id': 'user123'
    })
```
